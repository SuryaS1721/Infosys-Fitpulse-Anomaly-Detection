# Infosys-Fitpulse-Anomaly-Detection
FitPulse – Milestone 1: Data Collection &amp; Preprocessing This repository contains the complete implementation of Milestone 1 for the FitPulse – Anomaly Detection from Wearable Devices project. It focuses on transforming raw wearable sensor data (heart rate, steps, sleep) into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready format.
This includes cleaning, validating, and standardizing heart rate, step count, and sleep-related data to ensure consistency and accuracy. 
The preprocessing pipeline performs timestamp correction, missing value handling, outlier detection, and uniform time-series resampling. 
The final outputs form the foundation for feature extraction and anomaly detection modules in later milestones.



Milestone 2 expands upon the cleaned data from Milestone 1 by generating deep analytical features and short-term forecasting predictions. 
It applies TSFresh-based feature extraction, fallback rolling-window methods, Prophet forecasting, clustering algorithms, and combined anomaly detection logic. 
These outputs enable the system to understand normal behavior patterns and detect irregularities more accurately in the next milestone.
